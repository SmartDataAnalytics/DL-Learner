<h2>Quick Tutorial</h2>

<p align=\"justify\">
DL-Learner has a component based design to make it easier to 
extend and use. There are four components corresponding to the 
tabs you see: knowledge source, reasoner, learning problem, and 
learning algorithm. There are various components available of 
each type (selectable at the top of each tab). Each component 
has configuration options associated with it (middle of the tab, 
scrollable), which you can use to specify the settings for the 
component.
</p><br />
				
<p align=\"justify\">
In order to create a learning problem, you have to choose and 
configure all four types of components. The run tab plays a 
special role: It is used to start the learning algorithm 
and display statistical information.
</p><br />
			
<p>
<i>Example:</i><br />
Suppose you want to learn the definition of a class in an existing ontology. In this case,
you can proceed as follows:
<ol>
<li>In the tab "Knowledge Source", choose an OWL file containing your ontology.</li>
<li>Click on the tab "Reasoner". We recommend to the defaults unchanged here, but you
   are free to modify the settings and choose the reasoner you like.</li>
<li>Click on the tab "Learning Problem". This may take a while, since the reasoner will now 
   read the ontology you specified in step 1. Since you want to learn the definition of a class,
   use the drop down box and select "Class Learning Problem". After this, set the value of 
   the option "classToDescribe" to the desired class.</li>
<li>Click on the "Learning Algorithm" tab. Here, you can select a learning algorithm and 
   modify its settings. If you are unsure what to do, just stick with the default values.</li>
<li>Click on the "Run" tab and press the "Start" button. The algorithm is now running
   and the currently best solutions found are displayed in the panel below (using Manchester
   OWL Syntax) along with some reasoning statistics. Depending on the learning algorithm
   and settings, the run may not terminate (in reasonable time). In such a case you can use
   the "Stop" button to gracefully stop the algorithm.</li>
</ol>
For explanations of components in each step, please consult the DL-Learner manual.

gray/disabled = cannot be configured yet (mandatory configuration values missing)<br />
red = needs to be initialised<br />
black = component has been initialised
