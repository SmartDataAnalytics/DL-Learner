      gr:description "DescriptionYoungs Farm occupies a truly glorious position in the hills above Henley-on-Thames. The history of equestrian pursuits at Youngs Farm goes back many years with the land being the original home of the Household Division Polo Club which was relocated to Windsor in 1955 and re named Guards Polo Club. Youngs Farm was rebuilt in 1994 and completely renovated in 2006 with a high standard of fixtures and fittings; Stone floors, oak beams and fireplaces in a English style barn.The bright and spacious accommodation is arranged over three floors and is finished to a very high standard with a large amount of the wooden structure exposed in several rooms. The joinery and fittings are of a high standard throughout, the pronounced use of natural wood in the structure of the property, the kitchen, and all of the windows and doors help to create a traditional feel to the property. The magnificent dining hall is a focal point of the house with its vaulted ceiling, exposed brickwork, oak beams and heated stone floors. Large floor to ceiling windows flood the room with natural light and offer spectacular views. The bespoke country style kitchen/breakfast room features natural wooden units under polished granite work surfaces, a four oven Aga as well as other fitted appliances. This superb family space also has large bi-fold doors that open out into the enclosed rear garden. Upstairs the master bedroom suite has a vaulted ceiling, feature fireplace, dressing room, a wet room as well as a bathroom with separate shower and doors opening out onto a balcony offering sweeping views of the grounds and surrounding countryside. The superb secondary accommodation adjacent to the main property comprises a good sized laundry/utility room as well as the two guest/staff bedrooms, a sitting room, kitchen, bathroom and a large playroom currently used as a study. The excellent outbuildings are arranged around a central courtyard and are made up of a large barn/machine store with laundry room and a shower room, generously sized stables, feed store, tack room, foaling box, garage/store, estate office and 1st floor grooms accommodation. The grounds - offered separately - extend to some 75 acres and currently offer first class polo facilities surrounded by natural grassland and paddocks. The large lake is fully lined and is approximately 9ft deep. The lake provides irrigation for the polo field, as required an adequate bore hole has been installed with pumps to top up supply. The land surrounding the house is extremely private and the property is well screened from other properties. Looking out from the house are wonderful views up an avenue of trees, over the polo field and to the rolling countryside beyond.Due to the extensive land at Youngs Farm and the beautiful location high above Henley, next door to the prestigious Park Place Estate it has been envisaged that the construction of a large replacement dwelling may be considered. With that in mind the existing owners have taken advice from several renowned architects and guidance has been sought from local planning authorities for a replacement dwelling in excess of 9,000 square feet, not including subterranean levels. (subject to the necessary planning consents).LocationYoungs Farm is well positioned for access bothHenley and Reading, both of which offerextensive shopping, educational and recreationalfacilities.
