Dating from the 17th century this delightful family home offers spacious and characterful accommodation set within a generous, fully enclosed garden. The main house, a former coaching inn, has seen many changes during its historic past and has many stunning features such as an original inglenook fireplace with bread oven. Exposed timbers and stonework remain, as well as a useful accessible cellar with arched brickwork ceiling. 

The detached studio, originally a stable block, was converted by the present owner for the purpose of running the family business and offers versatile accommodation for other uses such as an annexe or additional living space. At the heart of this single storey building is an impressive 28ft room with vaulted ceilings and exposed beams. In addition there are two further rooms plus a fully fitted kitchen and bathroom. Bear House has been the subject of interest and research by local historians and it is reported that parts of the house have seen many uses such as a scout hall and village inn. 

Stanford in the Vale is a thriving and attractive village benefitting from excellent local amenities which include two pubs, a mini supermarket, post office and newsagent, primary school, village hall, social club and churches. The village also provides excellent access to Swindon and Oxford with the market towns of Faringdon and Wantage easily reached within a 10 minute drive.

The existing accommodation is in access of 2,000sq ft and provides spacious family living however the extensive roof space offers possible potential to further improve the accommodation.  Whilst neither planning permission or building regulations have been sought or applied for by the current owners, a design has been commissioned to provide five first floor bedrooms, two en-suite bathrooms and family bathroom, such a conversion would then greatly enhance and improve the available ground floor living space.  Please note we would stress that provision and publication of the drawings for the proposed roof conversion are for information purposes only and whilst the current owners believe that a planning application will be successful it is by no means guaranteed and interested parties should make their own independent enquiries of the planning department of the Vale of the White Horse District Council, 01235 520202. 




Childrey is a picturesque village centred around a village pond at the foot of the Downs with many fine thatched and period homes.  The village amenities include a primary school, church, public house, garage and village shop.  Wantage with a more comprehensive range of facilities and amenities is two and half miles away with access to Oxford a further 17 miles north.  Additionally, there is a main line rail station at Didcot (11 miles), which offers a fast service into London Paddington."""^^xsd:string ;

      gr:description "Victorian semi-detached cottage with planning permission recently granted for an impressive ground floor extension to the rear. This refurbished and modernised two bedroom semi-detached Victorian cottage currently offers characterful accommodation arranged over three floors to include a cosy sitting room with an attractive woodburning stove at it's heart and a refitted kitchen adjacent. The first floor has the family bathroom and a double bedroom access from a landing from which a staircase leads to an impressive loft room/double bedroom. The large west facing rear garden is a particular feature of this property and is laid partly to lawn with kitchen garden. The planning consent allows for an impressive extension that almost doubles the size of the ground floor with a spacious sitting room looking out onto the garden.
