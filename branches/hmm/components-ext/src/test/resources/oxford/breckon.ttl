doors that open to a dining room and further seating area which has French doors onto steps leading up to the garden. The principle
drawing room was two rooms but has been opened up and is particularly impressive with its high ceiling and clever glazed extension to the rear that overlooks the garden. Between the lower ground floor and ground floor is a cloakroom and sauna, and a wonderfully light
study with French doors to the garden. On the first floor is a double master suite with a particularly pleasant aspect, another double bedroom suite, a sewing room, and a laundry room. On the second floor are two further double bedrooms and a family bathroom. There
are also two floored lofts. Outside there is a beautifully landscaped west facing garden that is mainly laid to lawn with steps to the lower ground floor and a water feature. In addition there is a coach house, dating from the same period as the house, which includes a garage
with access from Walton Lane. Above there is a self-contained studio apartment with electric heating.

The deceptively spacious property now offers six bedrooms to the first floor, four receptions to the ground floor together with kitchen, bathroom and separate shower room.  The property appears to have originally been three cottages and together offers in excess of 2,300 sq.ft of internal floor area.  The former shop area has been converted to an additional sitting room/dining room with stone faced walls and beautiful open fireplace with log burning stove.   The former store room would make an ideal study and whilst it is not evident from an internal inspection there is actually an existing doorway to the external side passage.   The property is located very close to the centre of Bampton where an abundance of local shops, bars and restaurants are but a moments walk away.  Overall, a most substantial detached period home in a very popular village location.  

Bampton is a bustling village which sits close to the edge of the Cotswolds and is indeed one of the oldest in the area.  Whilst retaining much of the character of the traditional Cotswold village it is also a hive of activity, with a multitude of events taking place throughout the year.  Bampton boasts an excellent array of amenities for a village of its size with a post office, bank, library, a sports ground and pavilion, an art gallery, two churches, primary school, and of course the Market Square."""^^xsd:string ;
