Dual Licensing
--------------

Pellet is available under a dual licensing [1] scheme whereby use of Pellet 
in projects that are licensed so as to be compatible with AGPL Version      
3 may use Pellet under the terms of the compatible license. Please see      
agpl-3.0.txt in the Pellet distribution for more details.                   

However, if AGPL Version 3.0 terms are incompatible with your use of        
Pellet, alternative license terms are available from Clark & Parsia LLC --  
please direct inquiries about Pellet licensing to sales@clarkparsia.com or  
+1 202 408 8770.                                                            

Why Dual Licensing?
-------------------

Dual licensing has two advantages in this case:

1. it lets us focus on building Pellet as the best available OWL reasoner

2. it lowers the barriers of evaluation and adoption for organizations who
want to try OWL and Semantic Web technologies

Which License Should I Choose?
------------------------------

If your software is licensed under a recognized open source license [2], you 
can use Pellet under its open source license terms (see agpl-3.0.txt) without
further consideration.

However, if your software is not licensed under an open source compatible   
license, such as a proprietary license, then you should contact Clark &     
Parsia LLC in order to arrange alternative license terms to cover your use  
of Pellet.                                                                  

In short,

* If you derive a commercial advantage by using Pellet with a closed source 
  solution, you must arrange alternative license terms for your use of        
  Pellet which will, at a minimum, remove the need to publish your source    
  code.

* If you wish to use Pellet under its open source terms, you must           
  contribute back to the community the source code for the solution you use   
  Pellet with, so that others may benefit from it as you benefit from Pellet.
