 * possible solution: (male AND (EXISTS hasSibling.EXISTS hasChild.TOP 
 *                    OR EXISTS married.EXISTS hasSibling.EXISTS hasChild.TOP))
 *
 * The complexity of the learning task depends to a large extend on the length
 * of the smallest possible solution. For this reason this is a very hard 
 * learning task, despite the simplicity of the background knowledge.
 *
 * Note: Currently the data is insufficient, i.e. it allows the algorithm to
 *       to find shorter correct solutions than the desired one above.
