The ORE-Tool supports the user to check and improve the quality of ontologies. Therefore it 
allows to detect semantic defects, e.g. inconsistencies in the ontology are detected and can 
be explained by showing the relevant axioms. Another feature is to enrich ontologies with new logical axioms
by using powerful machine learning algorithms from the underlying DL-Learner framework.
