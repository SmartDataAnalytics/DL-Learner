This directory contains some files for the King-Rook vs. King problem.
See: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Chess+(King-Rook+vs.+King) 

To run all experiments, some of the OWL files have to be generated 
(contact us for further details), which is the reason why not all
problems in this directory are runnable. We decided not to include the
necessary large OWL files in the DL-Learner release.
