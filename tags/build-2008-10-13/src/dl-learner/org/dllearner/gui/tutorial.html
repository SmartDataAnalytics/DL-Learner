<h2>Quick Tutorial</h2>

<p align=\"justify\">
DL-Learner has a component based design to make it easier to 
extend and use. There are four components corresponding to the 
tabs you see: knowledge source, reasoner, learning problem, and 
learning algorithm. There are various components available of 
each type (selectable at the top of each tab). Each component 
has configuration options associated with it (middle of the tab, 
scrollable), which you can use to specify the settings for the 
component.
</p><br />
				
<p align=\"justify\">
In order to create a learning problem, you have to choose and 
configure all four types of components. The run tab plays a 
special role: It is used to start the learning algorithm 
and display statistical information.

<i>Tab heads explanation:</i><br />
gray/disabled = cannot be configured yet (mandatory configuration values missing)<br />
red = needs to be initialised<br />
