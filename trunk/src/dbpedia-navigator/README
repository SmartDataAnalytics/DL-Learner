General Notes:
==============

DBpedia Navigator is an application written in PHP using Javascript, HTML, and
CSS. It connects to the DL-Learner web service for getting navigation suggestions
and posing SPARQL queries against a triple strore containing DBpedia. Furthermore,
a temporary MySQL database is used to allow for efficient search and traversal of
the class hierarchy. Ideally, DBpedia Navigator, DL-Learner, the SPARQL endpoint,
and the MySQL database should all be on the same machine for performance reasons.
