      <h2>How to use moosique.net</h2>
      <h3>Searching</h3>
      <p>
        Before you can listen to music, you first have to search for something to add your first song or album to 
        your playlist. You can search for <em>artists</em>, <em>tags</em>, <em>albums</em> or <em>songs</em>. 
        If you are lazy and a last.fm-user, you can choose <em>last.fm</em> from the search-dropdown and just enter 
        your username, moosique.net will then start a search using your most used tags from last.fm.<br />
        If you are searching for tags, and your search is more than one word, the results will be better.
        For example: a search for &quot;rock&quot; will give you lots of results, where a search for "hard rock"
        will be more specific, giving you better search results. Just try it, you can't break anything.
        Sometimes searching can take quite some time, this is where you just have to be patient... but
        the system will always give you feedback on what it is doing at the moment.
      </p>
      <h3>Player and playlist functions</h3>
      <p>
        The player-interface is visible, no matter where on the page your are or what you are doing. 
        You can always get information about the currently playing song in the status-planel on the
        left, and you can always control the player with the buttons on the top-right. If you click
        on the tab &raquo;Playlist&laquo; you will see what songs will play next and you can change
        their order, or even delete songs from your playlist. There is also a &raquo;Recently listened
        to&laquo;-list where you have an overview of the last 10 songs you have listened to.
        You can reset both of these lists to &quot;restart&quot; from the beginning.
        You can always download a song to your computer you are listening to by clicking on the link
        &raquo;Download this song&laquo; in the player status panel.
      </p>
      <h3>Recommendations</h3>
      <p>
        moosique.net uses <a href="http://aksw.org/Projects/DLLearner">DL-Learner</a> to generate recommendations
        based on the songs you have listened to. These songs can be found when clicking on the tab &raquo;Playlist&laquo;.
        The recommendations are based on the tags of an album, or song 
        from an album, you have listened to. Recommendations are created every time you listen to a song for at
        least half its length, just like scrobbling on last.fm. You can also manually generate your recommendations
        by clicking on the corresponding link. If you have &raquo;Autoadd recommendations&laquo; checked, a new
        song from your recommendations is added, everytime they are generated. The system always remembers your
        10 most recently listened to songs by storing them in a cookie. So you can come back a week later and
        restart, where you left.
      </p>
      <p>
        If something goes wrong and you don't get any recommendations or they are not what you expected, 
        just try resetting your &raquo;recently listened to&laquo;-list and listen to some more songs.
      </p>
      <h3>More Info</h3>
      <p>
        Every time you start listening to a song, the tab &raquo;More Info&laquo; refreshes to show
        more infomation about the artist, you are currently listening to. If there are any external
        sources of information, you can access them at the bottom of the page, by clicking on the
        different tabs (such as Geonames location, last.fm profile etc.).
      </p>
