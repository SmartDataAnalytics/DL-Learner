A customer requirement is usually desired by at least one customer and usually specified or captured via requirements engineering systems for later inspection by software developers and maintainers. The goal of involving customer in the requirements elicitation process is to improve the quality of the software (see also: requirements elicitation, open source software, E-Government).
