This document contains (some) information about the models included in
this release and that may be downloaded for the POS tagger website at
http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml .  If you have downloaded
the full tagger, all of the models mentioned in this document are in the
downloaded package in the same directory as this readme.  Otherwise,
included in the download are two 
English taggers, and the other taggers may be downloaded from the
website.  All taggers are accompanied by the props files used to create
them; please examine these files for more detailed information about the
creation of the taggers.

For English, the bidirectional taggers are slightly more accurate, but
tag much more slowly; choose the appropriate tagger based on your
speed/performance needs.
