/**
 * Trains Example
 *
 * possible solution: EXISTS hasCar.(short AND closed)
 *
 * This is a very popular learning task in Inductive Logic Programming
 * proposed 20 years ago by Ryszard Michalski.
 * 10 trains are described, 5 of which are eastbound and 5 westbound. The
 * aim is to find the discriminating features between these two classes.
 * The file "trains.gif" visualises the learning task. (TODO: Find orginal
 * source of this file.)
 *
 * An important difference between learning in Desription Logics and standard 
 * Inductive Logic Programming is that the Open World Assumption is used.
 * In order to complete this example we would have to introduce definitions
 * and/or assertions to model the closed world (the closed world assumption
 * holds in this example, because we have complete knowledge of the world).
 * This is not done here, but the system is still able to learn the correct
 * definition e.g. using the standard settings of the refinement operator
 * algorithm.
