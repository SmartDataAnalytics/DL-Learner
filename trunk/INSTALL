Requirements
============
Java 6 and a reasoner is required.

Installation
============
No further installation is necessary. Just download and extract DL-Learner.

Running Instructions
====================
The instructions assume that you have a usable reasoner running (usually a
DIG capable reasoner running on http://localhost:8081).

Linux (and other systems)

Make sure the file "dllearner" is executable and run it on the command line 
followed by the name of the file to process, e.g. 
"./dllearner examples/father.conf".

Windows:

Run "dllearner.bat" followed by the name of the file to process, e.g. 
"dllearner.bat examples/father.conf".

All:

You can use the "java" command to run the program directly. Have a look at 
"dllearner" and "dllearner.bat" to see what the command looks like.

Web-Service
===========

If you want to run DL-Learner as a Web Service, you can run the scripts "ws" or
"ws.bat". They create an own local webserver running DL-Learner. An example
PHP client is also provided by DL-Learner. It can be downloaded at the 
sourceforge.net project website:
