Requirements
============
Java 6 is required. (All other libraries are included in the release.)

Installation
============
No further installation is necessary. Just download and extract DL-Learner.

Running Instructions
====================

Linux (and other systems)

Make sure the file "dllearner" is executable and run it on the command line 
followed by the name of the file to process, e.g. 
"./dllearner examples/father.conf".

Windows:

Run "dllearner.bat" followed by the name of the file to process, e.g. 
"dllearner.bat examples/father.conf".

As a convenience method, you can also run "quickstart". The script will present a 
numbered list of all examples found in the examples folder, where you can choose 
an examples. You can also call "gui" and load one of the conf files, change try
differnt configuration options etc.

Note: You can also use the "java" command to run the program directly. Have a look at 
"dllearner" and "dllearner.bat" to see what the command looks like.

Web-Service
===========

If you want to run DL-Learner as a Web Service, you can run the scripts "ws" or
"ws.bat". They create an own local webserver running DL-Learner. Some simple
PHP examples for using the web service are available at our SVN Repository:
http://dl-learner.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/dl-learner/trunk/src/php-examples/
